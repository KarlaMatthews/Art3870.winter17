<div id="about">
    Hi! My name is Karla Matthews and I'm happy that you stumbled upon my long scrolling website!
    This website was made for my 3870 Web Authoring class. The idea behind this website was that
    this was made for my grandparents. When this website was created, I had lost my grandmother over the
    previous summer. My grandparents house had an area in the backyard with these huge sunflowers and they always
    had butterflies around them. My grandmother was known as the butterfly lady by many people, so putting both the sunflowers
    that they loved so much, as well as the butterfly was a good representation of my grandparents.
    Even though my grandfather passed away 13 years ago, with my grandmother's more recent passing,
    I knew that I wanted to make something as a tribute to them.
